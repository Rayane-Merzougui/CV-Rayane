        <h2>Welcome to My Blockchain Developer Portfolio</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Rayane Merzougui, and I am an early-career blockchain developer. Passionate about blockchain technology, I have focused my learning on Solidity to create secure and efficient smart contracts. My skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enable me to build interactive and dynamic interfaces, providing a quality user experience.
  This site, entirely designed and developed by myself, serves as both a portfolio and a showcase of my skills. Here’s an overview of what you’ll find:
  <h3>"Guestbook" Smart Contract:</h3> A functional interface to interact with a smart contract I developed in Solidity. To avoid unnecessary fees for visitors, the contract is not deployed online, but it’s a guestbook where users can write and submit a message to be recorded on the blockchain. All messages are visible, but only the owner (myself) can delete a message by its index, which reduces gas costs. I can also change the owner. This page provides the interface for the smart contract; its code, along with the deployment and interaction code using ethers.js, is available on my GitHub as proof of my skills in the field.
  
  <h3>My Technical Skills:</h3> Here, I showcase several practical projects made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including examples of layout with grid and flexbox, a form, and an interactive calculator with a linear gradient background.
  
  <h3>My Contact Information:</h3> My social media profiles, email address, and GitHub are available, allowing recruiters and collaborators to reach out to me.

  I am always open to new opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects in the blockchain field. Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore the various pages to learn more about my skills!
